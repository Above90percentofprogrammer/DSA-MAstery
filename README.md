# ðŸ’» DSA-Mastery by Above90percentofprogrammer

ðŸ§  I'm solving **5 DSA problems daily for 30 days** to master logic, indexing, and data structures before jumping into full-stack development.

## ðŸ“… Progress

### âœ… Day 1 (âœ” 5 Problems)
- Reverse a string using loop
- Palindrome check
- Find duplicates with/without `count()`
- Get indexes of duplicates
- Sort 3 digits and get the largest

> All problems are solved with raw logic to boost brain sharpness and algorithmic control.
