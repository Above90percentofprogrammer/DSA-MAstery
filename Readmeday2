 What I Did Today:
Small Programs:..............

Built a character classifier (counting digits, letters, special characters).

Created a password analyzer evaluating 5 criteria: lowercase, uppercase, digit, special char, length.

DSA Problems Solved: ...............

Prime Number Checker â€“ Wrote two versions (including one using efficient logic).

Duplicate Removal from List â€“ Tracked indices and removed elements correctly using reverse iteration.

Anagram Checker â€“ Compared sorted strings.

Palindrome Sentence Checker â€“ Cleaned punctuation/spaces and compared with reversed string.

First Non-Repeating Character â€“ Used count() for checking character frequency.

ðŸ§  Key Learnings:
str.isalpha(), str.isdigit(), and str.lower() mechanics.

Difference between in-place methods (e.g. list.sort()) vs returning functions (sorted()).

Index shifting issues while deleting list elements and how to handle them.

Efficient range usage in loops (e.g. range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1) for prime checking).

Logic structuring using if-elif-else blocks smartly.

Practiced clean code formatting and clarity in condition checks.
